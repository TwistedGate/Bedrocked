# Bedrocked

Adds a simple machine that breaks bedrock *with energy*.
RF, ÂµI, IF.. things like that.

And allows to specify the radius, Minimum-Height and Maximum-Height of the area to be rid of bedrock.

It can also be turned off with a weak-redstone signal. (Doesnt have to have a lever directly on itself)

## Having a mod that has power generation is required!
**This mod has no energy production, and thus relies on other mods to take care of that!**

No license doesnt mean you can do whatever with it, this is not implied.
