# Bedrocked
adds a simple yet strong machine that is capable of breaking bedrock with Electricity. (Any energy that is based around RF like FE, ÂµI and IF)

It has means to specify the radius and Height-Range of the area to be rid of bedrock in its GUI. (Graphical User Interface)

A soft-reset button has been installed, incase it manages to get stuck.

It can also be turned off either via a redstone-signal or using the Toggle Button inside the Machine itself.
**Note that using the Toggle Button makes the machine ignore any redstone signal when turned off.**

## The machine does not include the means to power it!
Please provide energy from other sources!

#### No license doesnt mean you can do whatever with it, this is not implied.
